<h3>Keith Richards</h3>
    <p>Keith Richards is undoubtedly one of the most famous Telecaster players of all time. Hailing from the UK, he used it for his guitar playing in the legendary Rolling Stones and revolutionized rock & roll in the process. He is also famous for removing the low-E string on his Telecaster and using open tuning, allowing him to create unique and memorable riffs.</p>
<h3>Brad Paisley</h3>
    <p>Brad Paisley is a chicken-pickin' legend. He is an award-winning country singer-songwriter, and he is rarely seen without one of his many Telecasters. His skill as an all-around artist and amazing guitarist has brought him loads of success, making him an icon of country music.</p>
<h3>Prince</h3>
    <p>The late Prince was a pop force to be reckoned with. He not only had an incredible voice, incredible stage presence, and a unique style; he also had incredible guitar skills as well. He wielded a Telecaster for most of his career, including his blazing solo for "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" tribute performance at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2004.</p>
